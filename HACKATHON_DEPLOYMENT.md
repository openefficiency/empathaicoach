# R2C2 Voice Coach - Quick Hackathon Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Fast Track Deployment (15-20 minutes)

This guide will get your R2C2 Voice Coach deployed and running in the cloud for your hackathon submission.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Daily.co API key ([Get it here](https://dashboard.daily.co/))
- [ ] Google Gemini API key ([Get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
- [ ] Vercel account (free) ([Sign up](https://vercel.com/signup))
- [ ] Pipecat Cloud account ([Sign up](https://pipecat.ai/))

## Step 1: Deploy Backend to Pipecat Cloud (5-7 minutes)

### 1.1 Install Pipecat Cloud CLI

```bash
# Install Pipecat Cloud CLI
pip install pipecatcloud

# Verify installation
pcc --version

# Login to Pipecat Cloud
pcc login
```

### 1.2 Configure Environment

```bash
cd r2c2-voice-coach/server

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

Add these required values:
```bash
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
DATABASE_PATH=./data/r2c2_coach.db
```

### 1.3 Upload Secrets

```bash
# Upload secrets to Pipecat Cloud
pcc secrets set r2c2-coach --file .env

# Verify secrets uploaded
pcc secrets list
```

### 1.4 Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build Docker image and push to Pipecat Cloud
pcc docker build-push

# Deploy the agent
pcc deploy

# Check deployment status
pcc status r2c2-coach
```

### 1.5 Get Your Bot URL

```bash
# Get agent information
pcc agent info r2c2-coach
```

Your bot URL will be something like:
```
https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/r2c2-coach/start
```

**Save this URL - you'll need it for the frontend!**

## Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (5-7 minutes)

### 2.1 Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 2.2 Configure Environment

```bash
cd r2c2-voice-coach/client

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local
nano .env.local
```

Update with your bot URL from Step 1.5:
```bash
BOT_START_URL="https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/r2c2-coach/start"
BOT_START_PUBLIC_API_KEY=""  # Leave empty for now
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/r2c2-coach"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EMOTION_VIZ=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PLAN_EDITING=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE=false
```

### 2.3 Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (first time - will ask questions)
vercel

# Answer the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? Your account
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? r2c2-voice-coach (or your choice)
# - Directory? ./

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 2.4 Set Environment Variables in Vercel

After deployment, set environment variables:

```bash
# Set each environment variable
vercel env add BOT_START_URL production
# Paste your bot URL when prompted

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL production
# Paste your API base URL when prompted

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EMOTION_VIZ production
# Enter: true

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PLAN_EDITING production
# Enter: true

# Redeploy with new environment variables
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem:** Bot deployment fails
```bash
# Check logs
uv run pcc logs r2c2-coach --follow

# Common fixes:
# 1. Verify secrets are uploaded
uv run pcc secrets list

# 2. Check Docker is running
docker ps

# 3. Rebuild and redeploy
uv run pcc docker build-push
uv run pcc deploy
```

**Problem:** Bot doesn't respond
```bash
# Check agent status
uv run pcc status r2c2-coach

# View recent logs
uv run pcc logs r2c2-coach --tail 100

# Verify API keys are correct
uv run pcc secrets get r2c2-coach DAILY_API_KEY
```

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** Can't connect to bot
- Verify BOT_START_URL is correct in Vercel environment variables
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify microphone permissions are granted

**Problem:** Environment variables not working
```bash
# Redeploy after setting env vars
vercel --prod

# Or set via Vercel dashboard:
# Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
```

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** WebRTC connection fails
- Check Daily.co API key is valid
- Verify Daily.co account has available minutes
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

## Quick Commands Reference

### Backend
```bash
# Deploy
cd r2c2-voice-coach/server
uv run pcc deploy

# Check status
uv run pcc status r2c2-coach

# View logs
uv run pcc logs r2c2-coach --follow

# Rollback
uv run pcc rollback r2c2-coach
```

### Frontend
```bash
# Deploy
cd r2c2-voice-coach/client
vercel --prod

# View logs
vercel logs

# Set env var
vercel env add VARIABLE_NAME production
```

## Performance Tips for Demo

1. **Pre-load sample feedback** - Have a CSV ready to upload
2. **Test your microphone** - Ensure good audio quality
3. **Use Chrome browser** - Best WebRTC support
4. **Stable internet** - Use wired connection if possible
5. **Quiet environment** - Minimize background noise
