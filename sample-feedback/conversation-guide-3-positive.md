## Phase 1: Relationship Building (2-3 minutes)

### How to Respond

**When the coach introduces themselves:**
- "Hi! I'm actually feeling pretty good about this. I've heard the feedback is positive."

## Phase 2: Reaction Exploration (2-4 minutes)

**This phase will be SHORTER since the feedback is positive**

### Initial Reactions

**You might say:**
- "I'm honestly relieved. I was worried it would be more critical."
- "It feels really good to see that my team appreciates my leadership style."
- "I'm surprised by how positive it is. I'm my own worst critic."
- "The feedback about delegation is fair. I know I need to work on that."

### Processing the Positive

**Coach**: "How does it feel to see all this positive feedback about your leadership?"

**You**:
- "It's validating. I work hard to create a good environment for my team."
- "It makes me feel like I'm on the right track."
- "I'm grateful that people feel comfortable and supported."

### Acknowledging Growth Areas

**Coach**: "There are also some areas for growth mentioned. What's your reaction to those?"

**You**:
- "The delegation feedback doesn't surprise me. I know I tend to jump in too quickly."
- "Work-life balance is something I struggle with. I need to model better boundaries."
- "I can see how I might be too focused on my own team and not collaborating enough across teams."

## Phase 3: Content Discussion (3-5 minutes)

### Celebrating Strengths

**Coach**: "Let's talk about your strengths first. Sixteen people mentioned your people leadership. What do you think you're doing well there?"

**You**:
- "I prioritize 1-on-1s and really listen to my team members."
- "I try to create psychological safety so people feel comfortable taking risks."
- "I invest time in understanding each person's career goals and creating development plans."
- "I advocate for my team with leadership."

**Coach**: "Those are significant strengths. How can you leverage them even more?"

**You**:
- "I could mentor managers outside my team."
- "I could share my approach with other leaders."
- "I could help shape our company's management practices."

### Exploring Growth Areas

**Coach**: "Let's talk about delegation. What do you think is happening when you jump in to solve problems?"

**You**:
- "I think I'm trying to be helpful, but I'm actually taking away learning opportunities."
- "I worry that if I don't get involved, things won't get done right."
- "It's faster for me to do it myself, but that's short-term thinking."
- "I need to trust my senior engineers more."

**Coach**: "What's the impact of not delegating enough?"

**You**:
- "My senior engineers don't get to develop their leadership skills."
- "I become a bottleneck."
- "I'm working longer hours than I need to."
- "The team doesn't learn to solve problems independently."

## Phase 4: Coaching for Change (4-6 minutes)

### Goal 1: Delegation and Empowerment

**SMART Goal**: "For each technical decision or problem, I will first ask myself 'Who on my team could handle this?' and delegate to them with clear context and support, reserving my involvement for coaching rather than doing."

**Action Steps**:
- Create a "delegation decision tree" to help me pause before jumping in
- Identify 3 senior engineers ready for more leadership opportunities
- Practice asking "What do you think we should do?" instead of providing solutions
- Schedule weekly reflection: "What did I do that someone else could have done?"

### Goal 2: Work-Life Balance Modeling

**SMART Goal**: "I will not send work messages between 7pm-7am or on weekends, and I will take at least 2 weeks of vacation in the next 6 months."

**Action Steps**:
- Use email scheduling to send messages during work hours
- Set up auto-responder for evenings/weekends
- Block vacation time on calendar now
- Talk to my manager about workload if I'm consistently working late
- Share with team: "I'm working on boundaries and I encourage you to do the same"

### Goal 3: Cross-Team Collaboration

**SMART Goal**: "I will initiate one cross-team collaboration or knowledge-sharing session per month with another engineering team."

**Action Steps**:
- Schedule monthly coffee chats with peer engineering managers
- Propose a cross-team technical discussion series
- Look for opportunities where my team's work intersects with others
- Attend other teams' planning sessions as an observer

## Sample Conversation Flow

**Coach**: "Marcus, your feedback is overwhelmingly positive. How does that feel?"

**You**: "It feels great, honestly. I work hard to create a good environment for my team, so it's validating to see that reflected in the feedback."

**Coach**: "Your people leadership is clearly a superpower. Sixteen people mentioned it. At the same time, there are some growth opportunities around delegation and work-life balance. What's your reaction to those?"

**You**: "Those don't surprise me. I know I tend to jump in and solve problems instead of letting my team figure it out. And I definitely work too many hours."

**Coach**: "Let's talk about delegation. What do you think drives that tendency to jump in?"

**You**: "I think it's partly that I enjoy the technical work and partly that I want to make sure things are done well. But I know intellectually that I'm creating a bottleneck and not developing my senior engineers."

**Coach**: "Exactly. So how can we shift that pattern?"

**You**: "I need to pause before jumping in and ask myself if someone else could handle this. And I need to be okay with things being done differently than I would do them, as long as the outcome is good."

**Coach**: "That's great awareness. Let's create a specific goal around that..."
