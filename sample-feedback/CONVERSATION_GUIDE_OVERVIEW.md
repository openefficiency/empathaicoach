   - "I'm nervous about this"
   - "I'm not sure what to expect"

2. **Defensiveness/Hurt** (Early Reaction phase)
   - "This feels unfair"
   - "They don't understand the context"

3. **Validation/Relief** (Mid Reaction phase)
   - "Thank you for understanding"
   - "It helps to talk about this"

4. **Curiosity/Insight** (Content phase)
   - "I see the pattern now"
   - "I didn't realize I was doing that"

5. **Commitment/Hope** (Coaching phase)
   - "I'm ready to work on this"
   - "I can see a path forward"

### Signs of a Successful Conversation

- You have specific, actionable goals
- You feel supported, not judged
- You're motivated to change
- You understand the impact of your behavior
- You have a clear next step

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to say"
- Start with how you're feeling
- Ask the coach questions
- Share what's confusing or unclear
- It's okay to say "I need a moment to think"

### "The coach isn't responding how I expected"
- The coach adapts to your responses
- There's no single "right" conversation
- Trust the process and stay engaged
- Be authentic rather than trying to guess what to say

### "I'm stuck in defensiveness"
- That's normal and okay
- The coach will help you work through it
- Express the defensiveness honestly
- Ask "What am I missing here?"

### "The conversation feels too short/long"
- Pacing varies by scenario and person
- Don't rush if you need more time
- It's okay to move on when ready
- Trust your instincts
