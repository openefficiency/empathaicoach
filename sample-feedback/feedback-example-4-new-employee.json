Key development areas: 1) Deepen understanding of our users through research and testing, 2) Learn and consistently apply our design system, 3) Collaborate earlier with engineering to understand constraints, 4) Build confidence in presenting and defending design decisions. Jordan has strong potential and is on a good trajectory. With focused mentorship in these areas, they should become a strong contributor to the team."
