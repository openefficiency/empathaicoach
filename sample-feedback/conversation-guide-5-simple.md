## Phase 2: Reaction Exploration (2-4 minutes)

### Initial Reactions

**You might say:**
- "I'm glad people recognize my client relationships. That's what I care most about."
- "The CRM stuff... yeah, I know I'm not great at that. It feels like busywork."
- "I didn't realize my late-night emails were creating pressure for others."
- "The coaching feedback is interesting. I thought I was being helpful, but maybe I need to be more structured."

### Processing the Feedback

**Coach**: "You're clearly excelling at the core of your role—client relationships and sales performance. How do you feel about the administrative and internal communication feedback?"

**You**:

## Phase 3: Content Discussion (3-5 minutes)

### Understanding the Impact

**Coach**: "Let's talk about CRM hygiene. What's the impact when Salesforce isn't updated?"

**You**:
- "I guess it makes it hard for others to see what's in my pipeline."
- "Leadership can't get accurate forecasts."
- "My team might not know what I'm working on."
- "It probably creates extra work for my manager."

**Coach**: "Exactly. So while it feels like busywork to you, it's actually critical information for the business. What gets in the way of keeping it updated?"

**You**:
- "I'm always in meetings or on calls with clients. I don't have time."
- "I forget to do it until it's overdue."
- "It's not my strength. I'm a people person, not an admin person."

### Work-Life Balance

**Coach**: "Several people mentioned your long hours and late-night emails. What's driving that?"

**You**:
- "I want to be responsive to clients. They're in different time zones."
- "I'm trying to hit my numbers and help my team hit theirs."
- "I don't mind working hard. I love what I do."

**Coach**: "I hear your dedication. And what's the impact of those late-night emails on your team?"

**You**:
- "I guess they might feel like they need to respond right away."
- "It could create pressure to work those hours too."
- "I didn't think about it that way. I was just trying to be helpful."

## Sample Conversation Flow

**Coach**: "Taylor, your feedback shows you're crushing it on the sales side. Nine people mentioned your client relationships, and your numbers speak for themselves. How does that feel?"

**You**: "That feels great. Client relationships are what I care most about, so I'm glad that's recognized."

**Coach**: "At the same time, there's feedback about administrative tasks and CRM hygiene. What's your reaction to that?"

**You**: "Yeah, I know I'm not great at that stuff. It feels like busywork when I could be selling."

**Coach**: "I hear that it feels like busywork. Let's talk about the impact. When Salesforce isn't updated, what happens?"

**You**: "I guess it makes it hard for my manager to forecast accurately. And the team probably doesn't know what I'm working on."

**Coach**: "Exactly. So while it feels like busywork to you, it's actually critical business information. The question is: how can we make it easier for you to stay on top of it?"
