## Phase 1: Relationship Building (2-3 minutes)

### How to Respond

**When the coach introduces themselves:**
- "Hi! I'm a bit nervous. This is my first 360 review."
- "Hello. I'm curious what people think since I'm still pretty new."

**When they ask how you're feeling:**
- "I'm nervous but also excited to learn. I know I have a lot to learn."
- "I'm hoping the feedback will help me understand what I need to focus on."
- "I'm a little worried about what people will say, but I want to improve."

---

## Phase 2: Reaction Exploration (2-4 minutes)

### Initial Reactions

**You might say:**
- "I'm relieved that people see my design skills and enthusiasm."
- "The feedback about user research is fair. I know that's an area I need to develop."
- "I didn't realize I was deviating from the design system so much. That's good to know."
- "I'm a bit embarrassed about the onboarding redesign needing so much rework."

### Processing as a New Employee

**Coach**: "How does it feel to receive this feedback as someone who's been here for six months?"

**You**:
- "It's helpful. I'm still learning how things work here."
- "I appreciate that people recognize I'm eager to learn."
- "Some of this is stuff I suspected but wasn't sure about."
- "I'm glad to get this feedback now rather than later."

## Phase 3: Content Discussion (3-5 minutes)

### Understanding the Feedback

**Coach**: "I'm seeing three main themes: strong design skills, need for more user research, and systems thinking. What stands out to you?"

**You**:
- "The design skills feedback is encouraging. I'm glad my work is appreciated."
- "The user research piece makes sense. I come from a more visual design background."
- "I need to learn more about the design system and how to use it consistently."

### Exploring Specific Areas

**Coach**: "Let's talk about user research. What's your current approach to validating designs?"

**You**:
- "Honestly, I tend to rely on my instincts and what looks good."
- "I haven't done much user testing yet. I'm not sure how to set it up."
- "I know I should be doing more research, but I'm not sure where to start."

**Coach**: "And the design system—what happened with the onboarding redesign?"

**You**:
- "I didn't realize we had existing components that could work. I created new ones."
- "I was trying to make it look modern, but I didn't check the design system first."
- "I should have asked before creating custom components."

## Phase 4: Coaching for Change (4-6 minutes)

### Goal 1: User Research Skills

**SMART Goal**: "For each design project, I will conduct at least 3 user interviews or usability tests before finalizing designs, and document findings in a research summary."

**Action Steps**:
- Ask senior designer to teach me user research process
- Shadow a user research session this month
- Create a simple research template to use
- Start with small tests (5-minute hallway tests) to build confidence
- Share research findings with team to get feedback on my approach

### Goal 2: Design System Mastery

**SMART Goal**: "I will review the entire design system documentation within 2 weeks and create a personal reference guide. Before creating any new component, I will check if it exists in the system first."

**Action Steps**:
- Block 2 hours this week to review design system
- Create a Figma file with my most-used components for quick reference
- Ask design system owner for a walkthrough
- Add a checklist to my process: "Check design system first"
- Volunteer to help update design system documentation

### Goal 3: Cross-Functional Collaboration

**SMART Goal**: "I will schedule a 30-minute sync with engineering before finalizing any design to understand technical constraints and feasibility."

**Action Steps**:
- Identify an engineering partner for my projects
- Create a list of questions to ask about technical feasibility
- Share early sketches/wireframes, not just final designs
- Ask engineering: "What should I know about technical constraints?"
- Build relationship with engineering team through regular check-ins

## Sample Conversation Flow

**Coach**: "Jordan, how are you feeling about your first six months here?"

**You**: "It's been great! I'm learning a lot. I know I still have areas to develop, but I'm excited about the work."

**Coach**: "Your enthusiasm really comes through in the feedback. People appreciate your design skills and eagerness to learn. There are also some growth areas around user research and systems thinking. What's your reaction to that?"

**You**: "That makes sense. I come from a more visual design background, so user research is newer to me. And I'm still learning all the tools and systems here."

**Coach**: "That's completely normal for someone at six months. Let's talk about how you can develop those skills. What would help you get better at user research?"

**You**: "I think I need to learn the process. I'm not sure how to set up user tests or what questions to ask."

**Coach**: "Great. So you need some mentorship and hands-on practice. Let's create a goal around that..."
