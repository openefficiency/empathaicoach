---

## Overview

This conversation guide helps you navigate a realistic R2C2 coaching session with mixed feedback. Alex has excellent technical abilities but struggles with communication and collaboration—a common pattern for senior engineers.

---

## Phase 1: Relationship Building (2-3 minutes)

### What the Coach Will Do
- Introduce themselves warmly
- Explain the R2C2 process
- Acknowledge that receiving feedback can be challenging
- Create a safe, non-judgmental space

### How to Respond

**When the coach introduces themselves:**
- "Hi, thanks for meeting with me. I'm a bit nervous about this, to be honest."
- "Hello. I've never done something like this before."

**When they explain the process:**
- "Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate you walking me through it."
- "So we'll go through the feedback together? That sounds helpful."

**When they ask how you're feeling:**
- "I'm feeling a bit anxious. I know there's some critical feedback in there."
- "I'm curious but also a little defensive already, if I'm being honest."

### Key Points
- Be authentic about your nervousness
- Show openness to the process
- Build rapport with the coach

---

## Phase 2: Reaction Exploration (3-5 minutes)

### What the Coach Will Do
- Ask about your initial emotional reactions
- Validate your feelings without judgment
- Help you process defensiveness
- Create space for difficult emotions

### Sample Dialogue

**Coach**: "Now that you've seen the feedback, what's your initial reaction? What comes up for you?"

**You (choose based on how you want to explore)**:
- **Defensive**: "Honestly, some of this feels unfair. I work really hard and people don't see all the context."
- **Hurt**: "It stings a bit. I thought I was doing better than this."
- **Confused**: "I'm surprised by some of this. I didn't realize people felt this way."
- **Mixed**: "There's some good stuff, but the criticism about communication is hard to hear."

**Coach**: "That makes complete sense. It's natural to feel [defensive/hurt/confused] when hearing critical feedback. Tell me more about what specifically feels [unfair/painful/surprising]."

**You**:
- "The part about being dismissive to non-technical people... I don't mean to come across that way."
- "I just get frustrated when people don't understand the technical constraints."
- "I'm trying to maintain quality, and sometimes that means pushing back on timelines."

**Coach**: "I hear that your intention is to maintain quality and help the team understand technical realities. And it sounds like there's a gap between your intention and how it's landing with others."

**You**:
- "Yeah, exactly. I'm not trying to be condescending."
- "I guess I need to work on how I communicate those constraints."

### Emotional Responses to Explore

**Defensiveness**:
- "But they don't understand how complex this work is!"
- "I'm just being honest about what's technically feasible."
- "If people were more technical, they'd understand my perspective."

**Hurt/Disappointment**:
- "I thought I was helping by being thorough in code reviews."
- "I stay late to help people and this is what I get?"
- "I didn't realize I was making people feel that way."

**Frustration**:
- "I feel like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't."
- "When I communicate early, people say I'm negative. When I don't, they say I don't communicate."

### Key Points
- Express genuine emotions (the coach needs to detect and process them)
- Don't rush through this phase—let yourself feel the reactions
- The coach will help you move from defensiveness to curiosity

---

## Phase 3: Content Discussion (4-6 minutes)

### What the Coach Will Do
- Help you understand specific feedback themes
- Explore patterns across comments
- Distinguish behavior from identity
- Build understanding and insight

### Sample Dialogue

**Coach**: "Let's look at the feedback more objectively now. I'm noticing a theme around communication and collaboration. What do you see when you look at these comments?"

**You**:
- "I see that multiple people mentioned communication issues."
- "It seems like people appreciate my technical skills but want me to be more collaborative."
- "The pattern is about how I interact with others, not my technical work."

**Coach**: "Exactly. Your technical excellence is clearly recognized—10 people mentioned it. The opportunity is in how you share that expertise. What do you think is happening in those moments when people feel dismissed?"

**You (exploring the behavior)**:
- "I think I get impatient when explaining things multiple times."
- "Maybe I assume people should know certain things already."
- "I probably focus too much on being right rather than being helpful."
- "I might interrupt or talk over people when I disagree."

**Coach**: "That's really insightful. So it's not that you're a condescending person—it's that in moments of frustration or time pressure, you default to behaviors that come across as dismissive. Is that accurate?"

**You**:
- "Yes, that's exactly it. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to be efficient."
- "I see now that my 'efficiency' is actually creating friction."

### Questions the Coach Might Ask

**About specific incidents**:
- "Tell me about the Q3 planning meeting where you dismissed the product team's requests. What was happening for you in that moment?"
- "The authentication refactor was delivered late because you expanded the scope. Walk me through your thinking there."

**Your responses**:
- "I was frustrated because the requests seemed technically naive. But I didn't take time to understand the business need."
- "I saw an opportunity to improve the code quality, but I didn't communicate the scope change to the team."

**About patterns**:
- "When do you notice yourself becoming impatient or dismissive?"
- "What triggers that response in you?"

**Your responses**:
- "When I'm under pressure and someone asks what I think is a basic question."
- "When priorities change and I feel like my work is being wasted."
- "When non-technical people make technical suggestions without understanding the implications."

### Key Points
- Move from "they're wrong" to "I see the pattern"
- Acknowledge specific behaviors without defending them
- Show curiosity about your own reactions
- Separate your identity (skilled engineer) from your behaviors (communication style)

## Phase 4: Coaching for Change (5-8 minutes)

### What the Coach Will Do
- Help you create specific, actionable goals
- Develop SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Identify concrete action steps
- Build accountability and support structures

### Sample Dialogue

**Coach**: "Now that we understand the feedback, what would you like to work on? What feels most important to you?"

**You**:
- "I want to improve how I communicate with non-technical team members."
- "I need to be more proactive about sharing progress and blockers."
- "I want to be seen as collaborative, not just technically strong."

**Coach**: "Great. Let's make that concrete. What would 'improved communication with non-technical team members' look like in practice?"

**You**:
- "I would explain technical concepts without jargon."
- "I would ask questions to understand their perspective before pushing back."
- "I would validate their ideas before explaining technical constraints."

**Coach**: "Excellent. Let's create a specific goal. How about: 'In technical discussions with non-technical stakeholders, I will pause to ask clarifying questions about their needs before explaining technical constraints.' How does that feel?"

**You**:
- "That feels doable. I can practice that."
- "Yes, that's specific enough that I'll know if I'm doing it."

### Goal Development Examples

**Goal 1: Proactive Communication**
- **Vague**: "Communicate better"
- **SMART**: "Send a weekly progress update email to stakeholders every Friday by 3pm, including: what I completed, what I'm working on, and any blockers"
- **Action steps**:
  - Set Friday 2:30pm calendar reminder
  - Create email template this week
  - Ask manager to review first draft

**Goal 2: Collaborative Decision-Making**
- **Vague**: "Be more collaborative"
- **SMART**: "Before making technical decisions that affect other teams, schedule a 30-minute discussion with at least one representative from each affected team"
- **Action steps**:
  - Create a checklist of when to involve others
  - Practice with next architecture decision
  - Ask for feedback after first attempt

**Goal 3: Empathetic Communication**
- **Vague**: "Be less condescending"
- **SMART**: "In meetings, when I disagree with a suggestion, I will first acknowledge the person's idea ('I appreciate that perspective') before sharing my concerns"
- **Action steps**:
  - Write down 3-5 acknowledgment phrases to practice
  - Ask a trusted colleague to give me a signal if I'm being dismissive
  - Reflect after each meeting on how I responded to disagreement

### Questions the Coach Might Ask

**About measurability**:
- "How will you know if you're making progress?"
- "What would success look like in 30 days?"

**Your responses**:
- "I'll ask my manager for feedback in our 1-on-1s."
- "I'll track how many times I send proactive updates."
- "I'll notice if people seem more comfortable disagreeing with me."

**About support**:
- "Who can support you in this?"
- "What might get in the way?"

**Your responses**:
- "My manager can help me stay accountable."
- "A peer can give me real-time feedback in meetings."
- "Time pressure might make me revert to old habits—I need to watch for that."

### Key Points
- Be specific about what you'll do differently
- Commit to measurable actions
- Identify support and accountability
- Acknowledge potential obstacles

## Complete Sample Conversation Flow

### Opening (Relationship Phase)

**Coach**: "Hi Alex, I'm here to support you through processing your 360° feedback. This is a safe space—there's no judgment here. How are you feeling about this conversation?"

**You**: "Hi. I'm nervous, honestly. I know there's some tough feedback in there."

**Coach**: "That's completely natural. Receiving feedback, especially critical feedback, can bring up a lot of emotions. I want you to know that we'll go through this together at your pace. The goal isn't to make you feel bad—it's to help you grow. Does that sound okay?"

**You**: "Yeah, that helps. Thanks."

### Transition to Reaction Phase

**Coach**: "So you've had a chance to review the feedback. What's your initial gut reaction? What comes up for you when you read it?"

**You**: "Honestly? I feel defensive. The technical feedback is great, but the stuff about communication feels unfair. I work really hard to help people."

**Coach**: "I hear that defensiveness, and that makes complete sense. You put a lot of effort into your work and helping others, and it's painful when that's not recognized. Tell me more about what feels unfair."

**You**: "Like, the comment about dismissing the product team's ideas in Q3 planning. They were asking for things that were technically impossible! I was just being realistic."

**Coach**: "So you were trying to set realistic expectations, and it came across as dismissive. That gap between your intention and their experience—that's really important. What do you think was happening in that moment?"

**You**: "I guess... I was frustrated. I felt like they hadn't done their homework before making requests. And I probably showed that frustration."

**Coach**: "That's really insightful. So the frustration leaked through in how you communicated. And that makes sense—you're passionate about quality and feasibility. The question is: how can you maintain those standards while also making people feel heard?"

**You**: "Yeah, I see what you mean. I need to work on that."

### Transition to Content Phase

**Coach**: "Let's look at the patterns in the feedback. I'm seeing three main themes: technical excellence, mentorship, and communication challenges. What stands out to you?"

**You**: "The technical stuff is validating. But the communication theme is consistent—it's not just one person saying it."

**Coach**: "Exactly. Eight people mentioned communication and collaboration. That's a clear signal. What specific behaviors do you think they're experiencing?"

**You**: "Probably my impatience when explaining things. And maybe I interrupt people or talk over them when I disagree."

**Coach**: "Those are specific, observable behaviors. That's great awareness. When do you notice yourself doing those things?"

**You**: "When I'm under pressure or when someone asks what I think is a basic question."

### Transition to Coaching Phase

**Coach**: "So we've identified some clear patterns. What would you like to work on? What feels most important for your growth?"

**You**: "I want to be more collaborative. I want people to see me as approachable, not just technically strong."

**Coach**: "That's a great goal. Let's make it concrete. What would 'more collaborative' look like in your day-to-day work?"

**You**: "I would involve people earlier in decisions. I would explain my thinking without being condescending. I would ask for input instead of just announcing decisions."

**Coach**: "Perfect. Let's create some specific goals around those behaviors..."

## Tips for a Successful Conversation

### Do:
✅ Express genuine emotions (defensiveness, hurt, confusion)  
✅ Show curiosity about your own behavior  
✅ Acknowledge patterns even if they're uncomfortable

❌ Stay stuck in defensiveness for the whole conversation  
❌ Blame others for the feedback  
❌ Make vague commitments ("I'll try to be better")  
❌ Rush through the emotional processing

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this conversation, you should have:

1. **Processed your emotional reactions** to the feedback
2. **Understood the patterns** in what people are experiencing
3. **Created 2-3 specific, actionable goals** such as:
   - Weekly proactive communication to stakeholders
   - Pausing to ask questions before explaining technical constraints
   - Seeking feedback from a peer on communication style
4. **Identified support structures** (manager check-ins, peer feedback)
5. **Felt heard and supported** rather than judged

---

## What Makes This Conversation Effective

The R2C2 framework works because:

- **Relationship**: You feel safe enough to be vulnerable
- **Reaction**: You process defensiveness instead of staying stuck in it
- **Content**: You move from "they're wrong" to "I see the pattern"
- **Coaching**: You leave with concrete actions, not just awareness

This is a growth conversation, not a performance review. The coach is your partner in development, not your judge.
