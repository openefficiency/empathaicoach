**Profile**: Sarah Martinez - Product Manager  
**Scenario**: Difficult feedback with significant interpersonal concerns

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

This conversation involves **emotionally challenging feedback** with multiple critical themes. It's designed to test the R2C2 framework's ability to:
- Reduce defensiveness in difficult situations
- Create psychological safety when feedback is harsh
- Help process strong emotions (anger, hurt, shame)
- Move from blame to accountability

This is the **most difficult** sample scenario. Expect strong emotional reactions.

## Overview

Sarah is a strategic thinker with good product instincts, but significant concerns about collaboration, communication, and emotional regulation. This feedback will likely trigger defensiveness, hurt, and possibly anger.

## Phase 1: Relationship Building (2-3 minutes)

### How to Respond

**When the coach introduces themselves:**
- "Hi. I'm really nervous about this. I know the feedback isn't great."
- "Hello. Can I be honest? I'm dreading this conversation."

**When they ask how you're feeling:**
- "I'm scared, honestly. I feel like everyone hates me."
- "I'm angry. Some of this feedback feels like a personal attack."
- "I'm overwhelmed. I don't even know where to start."

---

## Phase 2: Reaction Exploration (5-8 minutes)

### Initial Emotional Reactions

**You can express:**

**ANGER/DEFENSIVENESS**:
- "I'm angry. This feels like a pile-on. People don't see all the context."
- "This is so unfair. I'm working 60-hour weeks and this is what I get?"
- "Engineering always blames product when things go wrong."

**HURT/SHAME**:
- "I feel terrible. Like I'm a bad person."
- "I thought I was doing okay, and now I feel like a complete failure."
- "I'm embarrassed. How do I face my team after this?"

**OVERWHELM**:
- "I don't even know where to start. There's so much here."
- "I feel paralyzed. How do I fix all of this?"

### Working Through Defensiveness

**Defensive responses you might give:**
- "Sometimes priorities NEED to change based on new information!"
- "They say I don't involve engineering early enough, but they're always too busy!"
- "If people were more responsive, I wouldn't have to escalate things."

**Starting to shift:**
- "I guess... maybe I'm coming across more harshly than I realize."
- "When I'm stressed, I probably don't communicate as well as I should."

## Phase 3: Content Discussion (5-7 minutes)

### Pattern Recognition

**What you might say:**
- "I see that my communication style is creating problems."
- "I think I make decisions too quickly without bringing people along."
- "When I'm under pressure, I just want to move fast and I skip the communication."

### Exploring Specific Incidents

**Sprint planning incident:**
- "A customer was threatening to churn, and I panicked."
- "I knew the team was at capacity, but I thought maybe they could squeeze it in."
- "Looking back, I should have talked to them first about what was possible."

**Understanding triggers:**
- "When stakeholders are unhappy or threatening to leave."
- "When I feel like we're falling behind competitors."
- "When I feel like I'm failing."

## Phase 4: Coaching for Change (6-10 minutes)

### Goal 1: Proactive Stakeholder Communication

**SMART Goal**: "Before committing to any new feature or timeline with stakeholders, I will schedule a 30-minute discussion with the engineering lead to assess feasibility."

**Action Steps**:
- Create a checklist: "Before saying yes, check with engineering"
- Set up recurring weekly sync with engineering lead
- Practice saying "Let me check with the team and get back to you"
- Ask manager to hold me accountable

### Goal 2: Emotional Regulation

**SMART Goal**: "When I feel urgent pressure or strong emotions, I will wait 2 hours before sending emails or making commitments, and talk through my response with a trusted colleague first."

**Action Steps**:
- Identify a trusted colleague as my "pause button" person
- Save emails as drafts instead of sending immediately
- Create physical reminder: "Pause. Breathe. Consult."
- Practice recognizing physical signs of stress

### Goal 3: Follow-Through

**SMART Goal**: "I will maintain a visible project tracker showing all active initiatives. Before starting any new initiative, I will review this tracker with my manager."

**Action Steps**:
- Set up project tracker this week
- Review tracker in weekly 1-on-1 with manager
- Practice saying "I need to finish X before taking on Y"
- Send weekly status updates to stakeholders

- Separating behavior from identity
